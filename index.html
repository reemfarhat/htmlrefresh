    <p>The New York City Economic Development Committee is beginning the construction of a dog run over tunnels believed to have been used by abolitionists to free slaves during the Underground Railroad.</p>

    <p>The dog run is part of the plans for Abolitionist Place, a public area being built in Downtown Brooklyn, and will be directly adjacent to 227 Duffield Street, a home owned by two prominent abolitionists in the late 1800s.</p>

    <p>"There is no logic behind that. And it's extremely insensitive to me. It just makes no sense," said Shawne Lee, 57, whose mother, Joy Chatel, owned 227 Duffield Street and led the effort to get the home landmarked after receiving an eminent domain notice from New York City in 2004.</p>

    <p>Eminent domain is the power of the government to seize property for public use. Chatel, who was aware of the building's connection to the Underground Railroad, sued the city in 2007 and ultimately was able to keep her home from being demolished due to its historical significance. She passed away in 2014, five years before the home was officially designated as a landmark.</p>

    <p>Harriet and Thomas Truesdell moved from Rhode Island to 227 Duffield Street in the mid 1800s. They were vocal advocates of abolition and were closely associated with other prominent abolitionists such as Henry Ward Beecher, who also lived on Duffield Street, and William Lloyd Garrison, according to the Center for Brooklyn History.</p>

    <p>The Fugitive Slave Act, a federal law passed in 1850, made it a crime to hide slaves and mandated that escaped slaves must be returned to their masters, even if they were in a free state. According to historian and preservationist Michael Henry Adams, the law made the Underground Railroad a criminal enterprise, one laced with secrecy.</p>

    <p>Despite this, Adams said it is very clear that 227 Duffield, along with other homes owned by abolitionists, were used to help slaves escape to freedom.</p>

    <p>"The railroad itself was secretive, but people who were advocates for the abolition of slavery were very conspicuous in preaching about the evils of human bondage," said Adams. "We know because there was no other way. There's no other way that they would have been able to do their work without utilizing their own property."</p>

    <p>The dog park is being constructed above where there used to be underground tunnels connecting 227 Duffield with the neighboring homes 223 and 225 Duffield, which have since been demolished.</p>

    <p>According to the New York City Economic Development Committee, construction on the 1.15 acre public space is expected to end before 2023.</p>

    <p>"It's our intention to honor the abolitionist history of the area, while recognizing and acknowledging slavery and providing a space to the community to memorialize and honor our painful past," said a committee spokesperson. "We are currently working to design a beautiful open green space for children, families, and adults to enjoy. This will be a park for children to play in, and an open space for community programming. It will offer residents outdoor seating and a water play area and playground for children."</p>

    <p>The plans for the space were officially presented to Community Board 2 last January without a public review. It was at this meeting that Raul Rothblatt, an activist who has been part of the efforts to get 227 Duffield landmarked for nearly 18 years, first learned that the dog run was to be constructed above where the tunnels used to be.</p>

    <p>"We were at this hearing, it was all online and I could barely speak, I was dumbfounded," said Rothblatt.</p>

    <p>Accoding to Rothblatt, while historians have debunked the myth that the Underground Railroad was an underground connection of tunnels, there is evidence to suggest that these passageways were used to assist slaves on their way to freedom.</p>

    <p>"There's an imagination, you know, just because there were tunnels. We don't know what happened down there. But it's a physical thing that people can touch. It's a physical connection. It's a physical metaphor of the interconnectedness of what was there," said Rothblatt.</p>

    <p>At a Dec. 8 general meeting, the Community Board 2 unanimously agreed to hold a public meeting with the New York City Economic Development Committee to discuss the possibility of  moving the dog to another part of the park. The date of the meeting has yet to be announced.</p>

    <p>Lee said she has hopes that 227 Duffield and Abolitionist Place can work in conjunction with each other as a community space that honors the history of the people who lived on the street.</p>

    <p>"My mom believed in the preservation of the community as well as the history,"said Lee. "She fought and died trying to get this message out and trying to preserve the house. I just want to make sure my mom's name is the name that they call every time they think of 227 Abolition Place and the Truesdells."</p>
